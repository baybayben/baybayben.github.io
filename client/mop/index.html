    <h2>June 10th 2016</h2>
    
    <p>The following are examples of the event pages:
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="event-landing_01.html">Event Landing - 001 →</a>
        <ul>
            <li>This page won't see much traffic, as the typical visitor will navigate to the event subpage which they seek. Probably upcoming will see the most traffic.
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="event-list_01.html">Event Upcoming / Event Previous - 001 →</a>
        <ul>
            <li>These two pages will use the same template, what will change are the date dividers.
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="event-single_01.html">Event Details - 001 →</a>
        <ul>
            <li>The detailed view of each event.
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="event-gallery_01.html">Event Gallery - 001 →</a>
        <ul>
            <li>I may have mis-named Event Gallery as Event Photography in a few spots. oops. Anyways, I'm not 100% sure what content you imagined being on this page, but I assumed it would be similar to Facebook Albums. Let me know if you had other intentions for this page.
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="event-publications_01.html">Event Publications - 001 →</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Similar in design as the example you provided. Will these link out to ISSU, or do we want each Publication to open a pop-up with the embeded book?
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <p>&nbsp;
    
    <h2>May 25th 2016</h2>
    
    <p>The following are examples of navigation design ideas:
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="home-02.html">MOP Foundation - 002 →</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Full hero
        </ul>
    
        <li><a href="home-01.html">MOP Foundation - 001 →</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimal approach. Subscribe will be replaced with sub nav on pages with sub menus. See MOPCAP examples
        </ul>
    
    
        <li><a href="mopcap-02.html">MOPCAP - 002 →</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Full hero - same as MOPF Home. This would only appear on some pages.
        </ul>
    
        <li><a href="mopcap-01.html">MOPCAP - 001 →</a>
        <ul>
            <li>This would appear on most pages.
        </ul>
    
    
        <li><a href="curate-02.html">Curate Archive - 002 →</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Full hero - same as MOPF Home. This would only appear on some pages.
        </ul>
    
        <li><a href="curate-01.html">Curate Archive - 001 →</a>
        <ul>
            <li>This was the first style which I started to like. It's minimal and easy. I don't feel like it gives the same wow, nor professional tone which MOPF represents.
        </ul>
        
        <li><a href="popup-01.html">Newsletter Popup - 001 →</a>
        <ul>
            <li>Wait 5 seconds and the popup will appear. Full overlay popups are very jarring to visitors, this approach is more minimal and less obstructive.
        </ul>
        
        <li><a href="donate-01.html">Donate Tag - 001 →</a>
        <ul>
            <li>This element will be glued to the edge of the browser on every page (including MOPCAP and Curate Archive). Click the button to view the slideout design.
        </ul>
        
        <li><a href="img/nav_01.png">Various Nav designs →</a>
        <ul>
            <li>These were the rough drafts that I built before getting to the above examples.
        </ul>
    </ul>
