Board Game Geek is the definitive database for sharing, discussing, and discovering boardgames. The database holds reviews, articles, session reports, images, videos, and files for over 84,000 different games and expansions, and over 23,000 game designers. BoardGameGeek includes German-style board games, wargames, card games and other tabletop games, as well as public-domain card games like Spades. The site also features bulletin boards, a marketplace, several online boardgames, and a gamer database to help gamers find each other in the same location.

My approach aspired to simplify the previous design of the Board Game Geek website. To create a landing page flow which catered to first time visitors, while balancing a member's page which aggregated content that they would find the most useful. 

When presented to a select audience (i.e. /r/boardgames) the design was met equal with praise and criticism. The new flow appealed most to new visitors whom were finding it difficult to overcome the barrier of entry of the previous design. Veteran members though found it too organic and denounced the flow as not having enough functionality to compliment power-users.

In the end, the design was shelved. The perspectives and opinions which the project generated were beneficial for the ongoing efforts to improve online board game communities. The project developed connections for my practice which were related to the field of boardgaming. I'm glad to of had the opportunity to present this new perspective.

I was approached by the EMERGEAST team near the end of 2015 to audit this current build. To say the least, it wasn't without faults. Most notable was that this was an eCommerce site without a checkout. Visitors needed to directly message the principles via a product form in order to request a purchase. 

After extensive research, we decided the best solution was to build a custom platform which used Wordpress as a base foundation. Integrating several APIs, such as Stripe for checkout, and Shippo for packaging, the end product was incredible fluid for the Emergeast team to edit, add, and update their inventory.
